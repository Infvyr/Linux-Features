<h1>Small bash scripts</h1>

Here I added some Bash scripts made while I was using Linux distros.

<br />

<strong>ftube.sh</strong> - is a small script that uses ffmpeg library and youtube-dl tool to faster download your preferred videos from any sources which host videos;
You can use it for:
- #1. Listing all available format
- #2. Choosing format and download
- #3. Listing your current directory
- #4. Extracting MP3 audio track from video
- #5. Converting MP4 video to MP3 audio
- #6. Converting MP4 video to 0GG aPaste the URLo
- #7. Converting MP3 audio to OGG audio

<br />

<strong>radio.sh</strong> - is a small script that joins my certain favourite radio stations in one bash script to enjoy at any time whatever genre of music I love listening to.
